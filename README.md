This is a 3rd party integration, and is not affiliated with Starling Bank.

> [!WARNING]
> At time of writing, models make frequent mistakes and are vulnerable to prompt injections. As this MCP server gives the model some control of your bank account, mistakes could be costly. Use with caution and at your own risk.

## Installation

**Step 1**: Create a Starling Bank personal access token. To do this:
- [Sign up for a Starling Developers account](https://developer.starlingbank.com/signup)
- [Link your Starling Bank account to your Starling Developer account](https://developer.starlingbank.com/settings/account)
- [Create the access token](https://developer.starlingbank.com/personal/token)
  - The token name can be anything, e.g. 'Starling Bank MCP Server Token'
  - Select the scopes based on what you want the AI system to be able to access

Keep the token handy, you'll need it in the next step. It'll probably begin something like `eyJhbGciOiJQUzI1NiIsInppcCI6IkdaSVAifQ.`, and be moderately long.

**Step 2**: Follow the instructions below for your preferred client:

- [Claude Desktop](#claude-desktop)
- [Cursor](#cursor)
- [Cline](#cline)

**(Optional, Advanced) Step 3**: See [PAYMENT_SIGNING_SETUP.md](./PAYMENT_SIGNING_SETUP.md) if you want to be able to send payments.
